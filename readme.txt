This is a pre-trained chatbot model that can understand and respond to user queries based on predefined intents. The chatbot model is built using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

I worked on this briefly on my freetime since the company was looking to implement a chatbot in the app, but due to higher priorities, we scrapped this.
